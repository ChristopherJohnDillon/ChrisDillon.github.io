        <h2>Where to Eat</h2>
        <div class="content">

<p> If you're staying down either-side of the wedding and looking for somewhere to eat Derry has some amazing restaurants – We'd really recommend: <br> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coupebythedirtysouls/?hl=en">Coupe By The Dirty Souls</a>, an excellent BBQ spot.
<br> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pykenpommes/">Pyke 'N' Pommes</a> , one of our all-time favourites - street food served inside an old double-decker bus.
<br> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/eltapasgra">El Tapas Grá</a> - Spainish Tapas with an Irish twist.
<br> And of course, the Walled City Brewery itself is a delightful spot to eat and drink, if you just can't get enough of it!
