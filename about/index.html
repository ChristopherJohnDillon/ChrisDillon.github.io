	<!-- <h1>Hi there, I'm Chris Dillon</h1> -->
	<p>
	I'm an astrophysics PhD student at Queen's University Belfast. You can check out my academic profile
	<a href="https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/persons/christopher-dillon">here</a>.
	<br>
	My main research interest is applying large-scale statistical analysis and Monte-Carlo modelling to detect and analyse below-noise floor signatures.
	These statistical and analytical techniques are initially developed for Biomedical applications
	and then are adpated for use in Astrophysical contexts.
 This has taken the form of Solar as well as Stellar nanoflares. These techniques are explained in more detail in the publications
	<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.06978.pdf" >Jess et al (2019)</a>
	and
	Dillon et al (in submission)

Outside of work, I can usually be found reading. You can check out my
