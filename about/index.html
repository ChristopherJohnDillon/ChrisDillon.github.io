	<!-- <h1>Hi there, I'm Chris Dillon</h1> -->
	<p>
	I'm an astrophysics PhD student at Queen's University Belfast. You can check out my academic profile

	<a href="https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/persons/christopher-dillon">here</a>.

	My main research interest is using large-scale statistical analysis and Monte-carlo modelling to detect and analyse below-noise floor signatures. This has taken the form of Solar as well as Stellar nanoflares,
	but also involves Biomedical image analysis. Nanoflares are Solar flare events, with a billionth the energy of a traditional solar flare.
	While less energetic, they are much more frequent, with theoriticaly thousands of nanoflares occuring each second in the sun.
	Against the bright background of the sun, or a star, these nanoflares lie below the noise floor, leaving them unretreivable by standard analysis.
	My research has focused on searching for the tiny statistical signatures which distinguish these nanoflares from the background noise.
	The simple explanation is that standard noise follows a standard distrubution in a large enbough sample, so examining the distribution of statitical fluctuation in a seemingly noise star liughtcurve,
	we can search for any statistical offset which is conssitent with our Monte-carlo modelled nanoflare signals. These techniques are explained in more detail in my publications *Jess et al 2019* and *Dillon et al *
