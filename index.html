<h1>Experience</h1>

<h3>Astrophysics PhD (September 2017-  September 2021)</h3>
<br>
My PhD project title is <q>Observations and Modelling of Intensity Time series for Biomedical
and Astrophysical Applications</q>. During the PhD I have developed very strong data analysis skills,
as I developed bespoke algorithims for the analysis of below-noise floor signals. Written and spoken communication
skills have been extensively developed, through academic publications and technical doucments and presenting at numerous conferences,
 workshops and catchup meetings with industry partners.
The synthesis of Industry and Academic experience allowed me to
develop excellent communication skills, and the opportunity to collaborate with
Biomedical colleagues from a range of different skill-sets and job-roles.

<h3>Process Engineering Intern, Seagate Technology, (Six-month internship, split evenly between June-September 2015/6</h3>
<br>
Role required leading an investigation into a manufacturing defect.
Required strong interpersonal skills, in order to interact with team members and deliver the changes required.
Emphasis on presenting findings to management, requiring confidence and strong presentation skills.
Developed my personal responsibility, as I undertook self directed tasks to solve this manufacturing problem.
Gained experience with R , as well as Six-sigma manufacturing philosophy.

<h1>Education</h1>


<h3>Queen's University Belfast, Belfast — Physics MSci
September 2013 - June 2017 </h3>

<br>
I attained a First class Honor in my degree. Studying Physics has taught me
how to work methodically, toward any goal, whether it be writing a lab report or studying
for an exam. This methodical problem solving ability combined with rigorous discipline allowed me to excel
 in this degree, and those same skills transfer to other areas. Naturally, there was a strong development of
 my numeracy and IT skills.
There was also a significant emphasis on ‘soft skills’ of presentation and collaboration.
 I am able to work cohesively within a team, under management and also direct teams.
